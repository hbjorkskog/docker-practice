This will be a test project for docker.

This is an online javascript editor, run in a docker container.

It is an assignment in the module INFT2002 Webutvikling, NTNU, autumn of 2020.
Some features are still not working as it is a work in progress.

To run this, you will have to run `docker build -t node-image .`

You will also have to run `npm install` in /server, as the docker functionality to install node in server isn't working yet.
